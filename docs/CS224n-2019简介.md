## Content

### What is this course about?

自然语言处理(NLP)是信息时代最重要的技术之一，也是人工智能的关键部分。 NLP的应用无处不在，因为人们几乎用语言交流一切：网络搜索，广告，电子邮件，客户服务，语言翻译，医疗报告等。近年来，深度学习方法在许多不同的NLP任务中获得了非常高的性能，使用一个端到端神经模型，不需要传统的、任务特定的特征工程。在本课程中，学生将深入了解NLP深度学习的前沿研究。通过讲座，作业和最终项目，学生将学习设计，实现和理解他们自己的神经网络模型所需的技能。今年，CS224n将首次使用 [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/)。

### Previous offerings

融合了earlier **[CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1162)** (Natural Language Processing) 和 **[CS224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/)** (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) 

### Prerequisites

-   精通Python
-   大学微积分，线性代数
    -   你应该熟悉(多变量)求导,理解矩阵/向量符号和操作。
-   概率和统计学基础
-   机器学习基础  [*A Course in Machine Learning*](http://ciml.info/)
    -   Reading the first 5 chapters of that book would be good background. Knowing the first 7 chapters would be even better!

### Reference Texts

The following texts are useful, but not required. All of them can be read free online.

-   Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. [Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
-   Jacob Eisenstein. [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)
-   Yoav Goldberg. [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf)
-   Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

If you have no background in neural networks but would like to take the course anyway, you might well find one of these books helpful to give you more background:

-   Michael A. Nielsen. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
-   Eugene Charniak. [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-deep-learning)

### Assignments

There are five weekly assignments, which will improve both your theoretical understanding and your practical skills. All assignments contain both written questions and programming parts.

-   Credit
    -   Assignment 1 (6%): Introduction to word vectors [[code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a1.zip)] [[preview](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a1_preview/exploring_word_vectors.html)]
    -   Assignment 2 (12%): Derivatives and implementation of word2vec algorithm [[code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a2.zip)] [[handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a2.pdf)]
    -   Assignment 3 (12%): Dependency parsing and neural network foundations [[code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a3.zip)] [[handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a3.pdf)]
    -   Assignment 4 (12%): Neural Machine Translation with sequence-to-sequence and attention [[code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a4.zip)] [[handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a4.pdf)] [[Azure Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHaQvbtPkfEGc93hxZpVhkKum1j_F1qsyJ4X0vktUDI/edit)] [[Practical Guide to VMs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9ST0IvxHQ3HXSAOmpcVbFU5zesMeTtAc9km6LAPJxk/edit)]
    -   Assignment 5 (12%): Neural Machine Translation with ConvNets and subword modeling [[original code (requires Stanford login)](https://stanford.box.com/s/t4nlmcc08t9k6mflz6sthjlmjs7lip6p) / [public version](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a5_public.zip)] [[handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a5.pdf)]

### Final Project

The Final Project offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth application. Students have two options: the **Default Final Project** (in which students tackle a predefined task, namely textual Question Answering) or a **Custom Final Project** (in which students choose their own project). Examples of both can be seen on [last year's website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/reports.html).

-   Credit：For both default and custom projects, credit for the final project is broken down as follows:
    -   Project proposal (5%) [[instructions](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/project-proposal-instructions.pdf)]
    -   Project milestone (5%) [[instructions](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/project-milestone-instructions.pdf)]
    -   Project poster/video (3%) [[instructions](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/project-postervideo-instructions.pdf)]
    -   Project report (30%) [[instructions](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/project-report-instructions.pdf)]
-   **Default Final Project** [[handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/default-final-project-handout.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/chrischute/squad)] [[lecture slides](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/slides/cs224n-2019-lecture10-QA.pdf)]: In this project, students explore deep learning solutions to the [SQuAD (Stanford Question Asking Dataset) challenge](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). This year's project is similar to [last year's](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/default_project/index.html), with some changes (e.g. SQuAD 2.0 rather than SQuAD 1.1, baseline code is in PyTorch rather than TensorFlow).
-   **Project advice** [[lecture slides](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/slides/cs224n-2019-lecture09-final-projects.pdf)] [[lecture notes](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/final-project-practical-tips.pdf)]: The *Practical Tips for Final Projects* lecture provides guidance for choosing and planning your project. To get project advice from staff members, first look at each staff member's areas of expertise on the [office hours page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/office_hours.html#staff). This should help you find a staff member who is knowledgable about your project area.
